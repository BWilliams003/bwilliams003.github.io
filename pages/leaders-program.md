# LeADERS Program

I joined the Learning through Active Discovery, Engagement, Reflection, and Showcase (LeADERS) program towards the end of my time at Old Dominion University (ODU). This program helped me to articulate the skills I gained through my college coursework, including:
<br>
- Leadership skills gained through Global Leadership
- Recognition for my cybersecurity intenrship at Kindo
- A deeper understanding of other cultures and identities through Race, Culture and Public Policy
- Effective conduction of quantitative research through Quantitative Methods
- and finally, Strong research and academic writing skills through Interdisciplinary Theories and Concepts 

In addition to allowing me to showcase these skills, as a commuter student who takes half of her courses online asynchronously, LeADERS gave me the chance to feel more involved with the ODU community and demonstrate my achievements from my time in university.

Below are links to my LeADERS-affiliated courses, which can also be accessed from the homepage or the course list in the navigation bar:
