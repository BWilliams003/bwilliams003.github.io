# POLS 418: Quantitative Methods

A survey of and practicum in the basic techniques of quantitative research, including the logic of empirical research, the identification of data sources, and the use of appropriate statistical techniques. This course introduced me to the STATA software and R programming language, both of which are incredibly useful in analyzing large amounts of quantitative data that would otherwise take much longer to process.
