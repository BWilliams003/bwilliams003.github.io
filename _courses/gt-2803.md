# GT 2803: Global Leadership

While attending Georgia Tech, I was a member of the Global Leadership Living Learning Community (LLC). As part of this LLC, I took the Global Leadership course, which taught me about the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), culminating in the drafting of a grant proposal which targeted one of these goals. This course strengthened my academic writing skills and exposed me to the world of academic and scientific research.
