# CYSE 368: Cybersecurity Internship

To complete CYSE 368, Cybersecurity Internship, I completed 150 hours of work as a Cybersecurity Intern at Kindo and completed the following course assignments. There are three reflections, which were completed after every 50 hours of work and include brief summaries of the work I completed and my feelings about my internship. The final paper includes an overview of Kindo, the management environment, and my work duties. It also discusses how the ODU Cybersecurity curriculum prepared me for my internship, as well as my reflection on the most exciting, motivating, discouraging, and challenging parts of the internship. Finally, I assess the learning objectives I set at the beginning of the internship and provide recommendations for future Kindo Cybersecurity Interns.
