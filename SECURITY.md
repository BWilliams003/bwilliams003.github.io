## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| `main` branch | YES — active security remediation |
| All other branches | NO — development only |

---

## Dependency Security Policy

### Ruby Gems (Gemfile)
All Ruby dependencies MUST be pinned to minimum safe versions:

| Gem | Min Safe Version | CVEs Remediated |
|-----|-----------------|-----------------|
| `jekyll` | `>= 4.3.4` | GHSA-4xjh-m3qx-49wc (CVE-2018-17567) |
| `kramdown` | `>= 2.3.1` | GHSA-mqm2-cgpr-p4m6, GHSA-52p9-v744-mwjj |
| `addressable` | `>= 2.8.0` | GHSA-jxhc-q857-3j6g (CVE-2021-32740) |
| `nokogiri` | `>= 1.18.9` | GHSA-353f-x4gh-cqq8 + 46 others |
| `rexml` | `>= 3.3.9` | GHSA-2rxp-v6pw-ch6m, GHSA-4xqq-m2hx-25v8, GHSA-5866-49gr-22v4 |

**Rule:** Never unpin dependencies. All new gems must be version-constrained.

## Secure Coding Standards

### For Jekyll/Ruby Projects (this repo)

1. **Dependency Management**
   - Run OSV.dev scan before every release: `bundle exec bundle-audit check --update`
   - Never commit `Gemfile.lock` with known-vulnerable versions
   - Use `bundler-audit` in CI pipeline

2. **Content Security**
   - All user-controlled content must be escaped in Liquid templates (use `{{ var | escape }}`)
   - Never use `{{ var | raw }}` with user-supplied data
   - Disable Jekyll's `--safe` flag is OFF in production (it's on by default for GitHub Pages)

3. **Configuration Hygiene**
   - NO secrets, API keys, or OAuth credentials in `_config.yml`
   - Use GitHub Repository Secrets for all sensitive values
   - Rotate any credentials that were ever committed in plaintext

4. **CDN/Third-Party Assets**
   - Restrict FontAwesome kit to your domain: https://fontawesome.com/kits
   - For additional CDN assets, use Subresource Integrity (SRI) hashes
   - Example: `<script src="..." integrity="sha384-..." crossorigin="anonymous"></script>`

5. **HTTP Security Headers** (implement at CDN/proxy level)
   ```
   Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://kit.fontawesome.com;
   Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
   X-Frame-Options: DENY
   X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
   Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
   ```

## Branch Protection Rules

The `main` branch has the following protections enabled:
- Required status checks before merging
- No direct pushes to `main` (PRs required)
- Security remediation PRs use naming: `security/snyk-remediation-YYYY-MM-DD[-vN]`
