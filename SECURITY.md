2. Email the maintainer directly at the address in your GitHub profile, or use GitHub's [private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| `main` (latest) | ✅ Yes |
| Older branches | ❌ No |

---

## Security Controls in Place

### Dependency Management
- Ruby gems pinned with `~>` pessimistic version constraints
- `bundler-audit` runs in CI to detect CVEs in `Gemfile.lock`
- `npm audit` runs in CI for Node.js dependencies
- Dependabot alerts enabled (GitHub native)

### Static Analysis (SAST)
- Gitleaks secret scanning in CI
- html-proofer HTML/link validation
- Jekyll config hardened (debug disabled, secrets removed from config)

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- `_config.yml` reviewed for secrets and misconfigurations
- OAuth secrets must be stored in GitHub Actions Secrets — never in config files
- DNS prefetching disabled (`x-dns-prefetch-control: off`)

### Content Security
- Content-Security-Policy meta tag recommended in `_layouts/default.html`
- See: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP

## Compliance Framework Alignment

### SOC 2 Type II
- **CC6.1** — Logical access controls: branch protection enabled on `main`
- **CC7.1** — Change management: all changes require PR review
- **CC9.2** — Vendor risk: dependency versions pinned and audited

### OWASP ASVS (Application Security Verification Standard)
- Level 1 controls applied for static site context
