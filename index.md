### Hi, I'm Bailey 👋
Welcome to my ePortfolio! I am an undergraduate student in ODU’s School of Cybersecurity and Department of Political Science & Geography, where I am pursuing a BS in Cybersecurity and a BS in Political Science with a Major in International Affairs and Global Politics with an expected graduation date of May 2026. I am concurrently employed as a cybersecurity engineer at Kindo, where I works on ways to utilize artificial intelligence to optimize security workflows. My professional interests include cybersecurity education, artificial intelligence, and psychology. In my free time, I enjoy traveling, reading, and learning new languages.
