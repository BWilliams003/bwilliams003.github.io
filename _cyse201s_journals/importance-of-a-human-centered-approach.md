I created this series of memes to explain the stages of attending mandatory cybersecurity training at your workplace. In the beginning, you do not yet understand the idea of human-centered cybersecurity and believe that cybersecurity is the responsibility of the IT department. As the training continues, you start to understand the importance of reducing human-related eros to lessen cybersecurity risks. Finally, after the training when you are taking an assessment on your knowledge of cybersecurity, you ace the test because you understand the importance of a human-centered cybersecurity approach.
