> Review the NICE Workforce Framework. Are there certain areas that you would want to focus your career on? Explain which areas would appeal the most to you and which would appeal the least.

I would like to focus my career on the Cyberspace Intelligence, Oversight and Governance, and Investigation areas of the NICE Workforce Framework. These areas appeal to me the most because I am interested in the intersection of cybersecurity and foreign policy/international affairs, which involves both the Cyberspace Intelligence and Investigation areas of the Framework. In addition, I am interested in the more human side of cybersecurity, so Oversight and Governance appeals to me because it focuses more on helping employees mitigate cybersecurity risks and developing cybersecurity curriculum and policy.

The Design and Development area of the Framework appeals to me the least out of the areas. I am not very interested in the programming and development aspects of cybersecurity, and would rather focus on the other areas.
