Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs consists of five levels: physiological, safety, belongingness and love, esteem, and self-actualization. 

Starting at the physiological level, technology helps you rest more effectively. Tools like bedtime calculators help determine when to sleep and wake to feel well-rested. 

At the safety level, technology provides a sense of security, enabling you to quickly contact law enforcement and share your location with friends and family.

At the belongingness and love level, technology makes it easier to connect with others, no matter how far apart you are. 

At the esteem level, social media can influence your self-esteem negatively and positively. People “liking” your Instagram story may momentarily fill you with a sense of accomplishment, while not getting an expected number of views may bring you down.

Lastly, at the self-actualization level, technology allows you to become more creative, giving you more creative outlets such as digital drawings and photography.
