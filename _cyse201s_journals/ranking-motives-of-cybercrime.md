There are many motives an individual may have for committing cybercrime, including entertainment, political, revenge, boredom, recognition, monetary, or a combination of reasons. Below is a ranking of these motives, in the order that I find them to make sense, with the first making the most sense.

1. Multiple reasons: Human psychology is quite complex, there is often no one single reason behind an action, including cybercrime. 
2. Political: As human interaction becomes increasingly digitized, it makes sense that forms of protest and warfare have also shifted online.
3. Monetary: As inflation continues to rise and the job market narrows, individuals may feel forced into cybercrime to make ends meet.
4. Recognition: Humans crave the attention of others, which may draw more isolated individuals towards cybercrime.
5. Revenge: While some may want to right perceived wrongs via cybercrime, to me it does not make sense to risk jail time by getting revenge.
6. Entertainment and 7. Boredom: To me these go hand in hand. While I understand the drive to see what you’re able to accomplish, I again don’t understand running the risk of legal action by committing cyber crime.
