Researchers may use the information on [PrivacyRights.org](https://privacyrights.org/data-breaches) to analyze different security breaches and to understand how breaches are distributed around the United States. On the website, the Data Breach Chronology includes information about the number and type of breaches that have impacted each industry, the geographic location of breaches, and detailed information about each breach reported to the database, including whether or not it was a unique breach. 

Researchers can use this information to study how different breaches impact different industries, and what type of cybersecurity measures should be in place to address the most common breach vectors for industries. By studying the number of unique versus total breaches, researchers can give recommendations on how to avoid the most common breaches. Researchers can also study unique breaches to find similarities that organizations may be able to address with the same control implementation, optimizing an organization’s cybersecurity response.
