Davin Teo’s background as an accountant has likely helped him in his digital forensics career. His accounting experience gives him an advantage when working with financial institutions, as he has a better idea of what to look for than someone with no background in finance. His description of being “put into” digital forensics work seems a common experience among older professionals in digital forensics and other cybersecurity-related fields. The lack of formal education programs in these fields enabled IT hobbyists like Teo to fall into digital forensics and other cybersecurity-related fields. In addition, his willingness to jump into digital forensics without knowing much about it catapulted him into the career.
