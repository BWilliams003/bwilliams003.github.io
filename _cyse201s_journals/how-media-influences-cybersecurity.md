The media influences our understanding of cybersecurity by portraying hacking as a very quick and easy task to accomplish. In many of the scenes shown in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=6BqpU4V0Ypk), the hacker is portrayed as gaining access to the target system in a very short amount of time. For example, in *Oceans 8*, there is a scene where the hacker can crack a 12-character password with a wireless tool in seconds. In reality, cracking a complex password of that length would take much longer, and would likely require a tool physically connected to the computer. This type of media portrayal of hacking makes it seem like no matter how secure your systems are, a hacker will easily find their way in. This thought process may discourage the general public from taking cybersecurity measures, like using complex and unique passwords, seriously. While it is true that no system is 100 percent secure, it is important to understand the value of strong cybersecurity protocols.
