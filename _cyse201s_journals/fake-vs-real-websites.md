The left screenshot is from the official Amazon website, while the right one was from a Cyber Advisors blog post about an [Amazon phishing email](https://blog.cyberadvisors.com/technical-blog/blog/the-amazon-scam-covid-19). As highlighted in the images, differences include URLs, typos, different wordings, different colors, and missing options on the fake login page.

The left Facebook login screen is from the official website, while the right one is from a Trend Micro article about [Facebook phishing scams](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/br/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/influential-facebook-brand-pages-stolen-via-credential-phishing). As highlighted in the images, differences include the URLs, using an insecure URL, different wordings, different placement of items on the webpage, different options available at the bottom of the page, as well as older logos and coloring used in the fake website.

The left image is the Google login page as shown in a [2016 blog post](https://blogging.nitecruzr.net/2016/01/create-new-blogger-account.html), while the right image is the phishing website used in an [attack against the Democratic National Convention](https://circleid.com/posts/20161017_dnc_emails_hacked_using_fake_gmail_login_forms) in 2016. While this was a successful attack, there are still many differences, as highlighted above, including an older Google logo, different fonts, the Google product icons included, the password and stay signed-in fields, and the information at the bottom of the screen. As a note, the last two differences may be because the user was logging into Blogger, not their normal Google account.
