After reading the article [Social Cybersecurity: An Emerging National Security Requirement](https://www.armyupress.army.mil/Journals/Military-Review/English-Edition-Archives/Mar-Apr-2019/117-Cybersecurity/b/), I have a clearer understanding of how the United States Army is treating the changing landscape of cybersecurity. As cyberspace’s role in military conflict grows, it is increasingly important to understand how bad actors can spread information using technology to manipulate their targets into behaving a certain way. It was interesting to read about how the way individuals process information online has changed from a more centralized model with journalistic accountability to a decentralized model where it is now the users’ responsibility to ensure that the information they consume is accurate. The BEND Model of Describing Social Cybersecurity Forms of Maneuver provided a deeper understanding of how criminals can manipulate knowledge and social networks to achieve their goals.
